DESCRIPTION:The FileOperations program is a simple yet practical Java application designed to demonstrate file handling operations such as writing, reading, and appending data. This program allows users to interactively store and retrieve text in a file, showing how Java can manage persistent data without relying on a database.

Key Highlights: Class Name: FileOperations – encapsulates all file-related operations.

Purpose: To write user input to a file. To read and display file contents. To append additional text to the file multiple times. To demonstrate cumulative file handling and interactive user input.

User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter text to write to example.txt. After the initial write, it reads and displays the contents. Users can repeatedly append text until they choose to stop. Final file contents are displayed to confirm all changes. Java Classes Used: FileWriter – for writing and appending text to files. FileReader – to open files for reading. BufferedReader – for efficiently reading files line by line. Scanner – to capture dynamic input from the user.

Development Tool: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – used for coding, debugging, and running the Java program.

Features: Write Operation: Stores initial user input in a file. Read Operation: Displays file contents to verify correctness. Append Operation: Allows adding multiple entries without overwriting previous content. Exception Handling: Manages potential errors during file I/O operations using try-catch.

Applicability: Educational: Helps beginners understand Java I/O, exception handling, and loops. Practical: Useful for creating logs, storing user-generated data, configuration files, or small datasets in lightweight applications. Automation & Reports: Can be adapted for scripts that generate or update files automatically.

Key Learning Outcomes: Understanding file creation, reading, and appending in Java. Managing exceptions for safer file operations. Using loops and conditional logic for interactive programs. Combining multiple Java I/O classes for practical file handling tasks.
